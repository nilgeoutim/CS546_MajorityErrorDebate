This means that the Comet passed 30 + 75 = 105 years ago.\n\nSo, when Bill saw the Comet for the first time, it passed x years ago. Therefore, we can write the equation:\nx + 105 = x*3\n\nSolving the equation:\nx + 105 = 3x\n105 = 2x\nx = 52.5\n\nSince age cannot be in decimal numbers, this means that x must be a whole number.

This means that when Bill saw the Comet for the first time, his dad was 30+x years old.\n\nAccording to the problem, Bill saw the Comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the Comet. This means that Bill was 3*(30+x) years old when he saw the Comet for the second time.\n\nSince Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years, we know that Bill saw the Comet for the second time when he was 75 years old (75 is a multiple of the orbit period). Therefore, 3*(30+x) = 75.\n\nSolving for x:\n3*(30+x) = 75\n90 + 3x = 75\n3x = 75 - 90\n3x = -15\nx = -5\n\nSince age cannot be negative, Bill must have been 5 when he first saw Comet Halley.\n\nTherefore, Bill was \\boxed{5} years old when he saw Comet Halley for the first time., score 4/10\n\nYour score 4/10 is lower than others.\nFind your error and learn from higher-scoring agents.\n\nOriginal Problem: Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years.
