We know that Bill's dad saw the Comet when he was 30 years old, so let's denote his age as D.\n\nSince Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years, the age gap between when Bill's dad saw the Comet and when Bill saw it for the first time is 75 years.\n\nWe also know that Bill saw the Comet for the first time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the Comet. Therefore, we can create the following equation:\n\nB = 3(D - 30)\n\nNow, we substitute the value of D in terms of B into the first equation:\n\nB = 3B - 90\n2B = 90\nB = 45\n\nTherefore, Bill was 45 years old when he saw the Comet for the first time.\n\n\\boxed{45}```, its score is 5/10\nOne agent's answer:  ```Let's denote Bill's age when he saw the Comet for the first time as B.\n\nWe know that Bill's dad saw the Comet when he was 30 years old.

This equation can be expressed as B = 3(30 + 75).\n\nSolving this equation, we get:\nB = 3(105)\nB = 315\n\nTherefore, Bill was 315 years old when he saw the Comet for the first time.\n\n\\boxed{315}```, its score is 1/10\n\nBased on these scores:\n\n- If your score is significantly higher than others, KEEP and DEFEND your reasoning and answer.\n- If your score is significantly lower, STUDY the highest-scoring agent\u2019s answer and adjust your reasoning accordingly.\n\nPlease provide your updated reasoning and answer to the original problem:\nComet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years.
