We know the time difference between the two sightings of Comet Halley, and we can express the ages using this time difference and the given information.\n\n### Step 2 \u2014 Strategy-Guided Reasoning\nLet \\( x \\) be the number of years since Bill's dad saw the Comet when Bill saw it for the first time.

We will use the fact that when Bill saw the comet for the first time, his age was a certain multiple of the number of orbits.\n\n### Step 2 \u2014 Strategy-Guided Reasoning\nLet's denote the age at which Bill saw the Comet for the first time as $B$. We are given that Bill's dad saw the Comet when he was 30 years old and that the Comet orbits the sun every 75 years.\n\nWhen Bill saw the comet for the first time, his father's age would have been equal to the number of orbits before Bill's age. Therefore, Bill's age when he saw the Comet for the first time is given by:\n$B = 30 + n \\times 75$\n\nWe are also given that Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the Comet. If we denote the age at which Bill saw the Comet for the second time as $3(30 + 75) = 3(105)$, then the time that has passed between the two sightings is $3(105) - (30 + n \\times 75)$.\n\nThis time gap can also be expressed as the number of orbits that occurred between the two sightings. Therefore, we can write:\n$B + 75 = 3(105) + n \\times 75$\n\nSolving these two equations simultaneously will give us the age at which Bill saw the Comet for the first time, $B$.\n\n### Final Answer\nAfter solving the equations, we find that $B = \\boxed{105}$ years old when Bill saw the Comet for the first time.```\n\nOne agent solution:\n```### Step 1 \u2014 Strategy Elicitation\nLet's use a reasoning strategy based on the given information about the ages of Bill and his dad when they saw Comet Halley.\n\n### Step 2 \u2014 Strategy-Guided Reasoning\nLet:\n- Bill's dad's age when he saw the Comet be \\(d\\) years.\n- Bill's age when he saw the Comet for the first time be \\(b\\) years.\n\nFrom the information given:\n1. Bill's dad saw the Comet when he was 30 years old, so \\(d = 30\\).\n2. Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the Comet. This can be represented as: \\(b = 3d\\).\n\nWe know that Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years. Since the age difference between Bill seeing the Comet the first time and the second time is the same as the orbital period of the Comet, we can write:\n\\[b_2 - b_1 = 75\\]\n\\[3d - d = 75\\]\n\\[2d = 75\\]\n\\[d = 37.5\\]\n\nHowever, since a person can't be half years old, this means Bill's dad was 38 years old when he saw the Comet for the first time.

We will use the fact that when Bill saw the comet for the first time, his age was a certain multiple of the number of orbits.\n\n### Step 2 \u2014 Strategy-Guided Reasoning\nLet's denote the age at which Bill saw the Comet for the first time as $B$. We are given that Bill's dad saw the Comet when he was 30 years old and that the Comet orbits the sun every 75 years.\n\nWhen Bill saw the comet for the first time, his father's age would have been equal to the number of orbits before Bill's age. Therefore, Bill's age when he saw the Comet for the first time is given by:\n$B = 30 + n \\times 75$\n\nWe are also given that Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the Comet. If we denote the age at which Bill saw the Comet for the second time as $3(30 + 75) = 3(105)$, then the time that has passed between the two sightings is $3(105) - (30 + n \\times 75)$.\n\nThis time gap can also be expressed as the number of orbits that occurred between the two sightings. Therefore, we can write:\n$B + 75 = 3(105) + n \\times 75$\n\nSolving these two equations simultaneously will give us the age at which Bill saw the Comet for the first time, $B$.\n\n### Final Answer\nAfter solving the equations, we find that $B = \\boxed{105}$ years old when Bill saw the Comet for the first time.```\n\nOne agent solution:\n```### Step 1 \u2014 Strategy Elicitation\nLet's use a reasoning strategy based on the given information about the ages of Bill and his dad when they saw Comet Halley.\n\n### Step 2 \u2014 Strategy-Guided Reasoning\nLet:\n- Bill's dad's age when he saw the Comet be \\(d\\) years.\n- Bill's age when he saw the Comet for the first time be \\(b\\) years.\n\nFrom the information given:\n1.

This can be represented as: \\(b = 3d\\).\n\nWe know that Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years. Since the age difference between Bill seeing the Comet the first time and the second time is the same as the orbital period of the Comet, we can write:\n\\[b_2 - b_1 = 75\\]\n\\[3d - d = 75\\]\n\\[2d = 75\\]\n\\[d = 37.5\\]\n\nHowever, since a person can't be half years old, this means Bill's dad was 38 years old when he saw the Comet for the first time.

We will use the fact that when Bill saw the comet for the first time, his age was a certain multiple of the number of orbits.\n\n### Step 2 \u2014 Strategy-Guided Reasoning\nLet's denote the age at which Bill saw the Comet for the first time as $B$. We are given that Bill's dad saw the Comet when he was 30 years old and that the Comet orbits the sun every 75 years.\n\nWhen Bill saw the comet for the first time, his father's age would have been equal to the number of orbits before Bill's age. Therefore, Bill's age when he saw the Comet for the first time is given by:\n$B = 30 + n \\times 75$\n\nWe are also given that Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the Comet. If we denote the age at which Bill saw the Comet for the second time as $3(30 + 75) = 3(105)$, then the time that has passed between the two sightings is $3(105) - (30 + n \\times 75)$.\n\nThis time gap can also be expressed as the number of orbits that occurred between the two sightings. Therefore, we can write:\n$B + 75 = 3(105) + n \\times 75$\n\nSolving these two equations simultaneously will give us the age at which Bill saw the Comet for the first time, $B$.\n\n### Final Answer\nAfter solving the equations, we find that $B = \\boxed{105}$ years old when Bill saw the Comet for the first time."

This can be represented as: \\(b = 3d\\).\n\nWe know that Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years.

There seems to be an error in the assumptions made. Let's reassess the information given:\n\nBill's dad saw the Comet when he was 30 years old. If Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the Comet, it implies that his dad was younger than 30 when he saw the Comet.

Bill's dad saw the Comet when he was 30 years old:\n\\[ 30 = x + 75 \\]\n\\[ x = 30 - 75 \\]\n\\[ x = -45 \\] (This means that Bill would have to be -45 years old to see the Comet for the first time, which is not possible.)\n\n2.

Therefore, we can express the relationship between their ages at the two sightings as:\n\\[ B = D + 75 \\]\n\nSubstitute the value of \\(D\\) from the first condition into the equation relating their ages:\n\\[ 3 \\times (D - 30) = D + 75 \\]\n\\[ 3D - 90 = D + 75 \\]\n\\[ 3D - D = 75 + 90 \\]\n\\[ 2D = 165 \\]\n\\[ D = \\frac{165}{2} \\]\n\\[ D = 82.5 \\]\n\nHowever, it is illogical for Bill's dad to be 82.5 years old when he saw Comet Halley, indicating a discrepancy in the information provided.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe age for Bill when he saw the Comet for the first time cannot be accurately determined due to inconsistencies in the problem statement. Therefore, the age of Bill when he first saw the Comet remains \\(\\boxed{\\text{indeterminable}}\\)."

To get 6 pounds, he would need to buy 4 pounds (for the regular price), and then he would get 2 pounds at half off.\n\n3. The cost of each pound of butter is $4.00. Therefore, the cost of purchasing 4 pounds would be 4 * $4.00 = $16.00.\n\n4. For the 2 pounds purchased at half off, each pound would cost $4.00 / 2 = $2.00. Therefore, the total cost for these 2 pounds would be 2 * $2.00 = $4.00.\n\n5. Adding the costs of the 4 pounds and 2 pounds of butter, the total cost of purchasing 6 pounds of butter would be $16.00 + $4.00 = $20.00.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{20.00}```\n\n\nUsing the above as hints, re-solve the problem using Strategic Chain-of-Thought:\n\n### Step 1 \u2014 Identify the best strategy\nExtract the most reliable and effective strategy (no computation here).\n\n### Step 2 \u2014 Apply the strategy\nSolve the problem strictly following the chosen strategy.\n\nReturn the final answer in \\boxed{answer}.\n\nOriginal problem:\nDennis uses 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants that he makes.

Since Dennis uses 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants, and he needs to make 6 dozen croissants, he will need 6 * 1 = 6 pounds of butter.\n\n2. Since the grocery store has a promotion of buy one pound of butter and get one half off, Dennis needs to calculate how many pounds of butter he actually needs to buy in order to get 6 pounds. To get 6 pounds, he would need to buy 4 pounds (for the regular price), and then he would get 2 pounds at half off.\n\n3. The cost of each pound of butter is $4.00. Therefore, the cost of purchasing 4 pounds would be 4 * $4.00 = $16.00.\n\n4. For the 2 pounds purchased at half off, each pound would cost $4.00 / 2 = $2.00. Therefore, the total cost for these 2 pounds would be 2 * $2.00 = $4.00.\n\n5. Adding the costs of the 4 pounds and 2 pounds of butter, the total cost of purchasing 6 pounds of butter would be $16.00 + $4.00 = $20.00.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{20.00}"
