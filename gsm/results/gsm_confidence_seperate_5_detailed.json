    "answer": "Abraham sold 1/2 x 80= <<1/2*80=40>>40 square meters of his unused land.\nAfter a month, he sold 1/4 x 40 = <<1/4*40=10>>10 square meters of his land.\nSo, the total land he already sold is 40+10= <<50=50>>50 square meters of his land.\nHe has 80 - 50 = <<80-50=30>>30 remaining land to be sold at $3 per square meter.\nSo he earned $3 x 30 = $<<3*30=90>>90 for that land.\nTherefore, he earned a total of $50 + $30 + $90 = $<<50+30+90=170>>170.\n#### 170"
