Calculate the cost of purchasing 6 pounds of butter:\n- Regular price for 6 pounds of butter: 6 pounds * $4.00 per pound = $24.00\n- With the promotion, Dennis will get one half off for each pound he buys. So, for every 2 pounds he buys, he will pay the price of 1 pound.\n- Since he needs 6 pounds, he will actually pay for 3 pounds.\n- Cost with promotion: 3 pounds * $4.00 per pound = $12.00\n\n[Final Answer]\n\\boxed{12.00}"

Abraham sold half of his land, which is 80/2 = 40 square meters, for $50. This means he sold each square meter for $50/40 = $1.25 per square meter.\n2. Abraham sold another 1/4 of his land, which is 80/4 = 20 square meters, for $30. This means he sold each square meter for $30/20 = $1.50 per square meter.\n3.
